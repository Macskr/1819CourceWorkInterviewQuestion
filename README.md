PROGRESS:
- Randomly Generated Data
   - ISSUES
        -    the for loop responsible for generating an individual creates one identical one already in the dictionary. this means that if a large set is requested (10000) the returned file could only contain much less (~7000)  [RESOLVED]
        -    the generation is limited to the ammount of names avalible , to fix this may turn key of the individual to a set ( {name,surname,age}  OR  {name,age} ) [UNRESOLVED]
